This is the containerized service infrastructure for jbovlaste.

This is an LBCS instance (see https://github.com/lojban/lbcs/ ), which is why a
bunch of things in here are symlinks off into apparently empty space; you have
to have LBCS installed in /opt/lbcs/ for them to work.

That's also where the docs on how to like start and stop the service and so on
are.
